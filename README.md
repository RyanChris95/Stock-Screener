📊 Stock Screener & Conditional Probability Analysis

Welcome! This repository showcases two complementary data science projects exploring applied analytics in both finance and probability theory. Together, they demonstrate end-to-end data wrangling, modeling, and visualization using Python.

💡 Project Motivation

These projects were developed as part of my ongoing work to strengthen data science fundamentals while applying them to real-world analytical challenges.

The Stock Screener demonstrates how automation, modeling, and visualization can uncover actionable insights from large financial datasets.

The Conditional Probability Analysis highlights my commitment to understanding the mathematical foundations that underpin data-driven decision making.

Together, they reflect my approach to analytics: combining practical engineering skills with statistical intuition to produce clear, impactful results.

🚀 Projects Overview
1. Stock Screener & Predictive Analysis (Screener.ipynb)

This notebook builds a Python-based stock screener capable of analyzing historical market data and performing predictive modeling on stock prices.
It demonstrates how data pipelines, statistical analysis, and visualization can be combined to make data-driven investment insights.

🔍 Highlights
